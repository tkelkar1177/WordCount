Goal 1:
The first mapreduce in this project takes the log file and performs string matching across each word and compares it
with the given log message types (ERROR, INFO,DEBUG,WARN) and for each match it sends the message type as a key and
an IntWritable object which has the value 1 and stores such pairs. The reducer takes key value pair multisets and adds
the total number of instances of each message type and stores the total sum for each instance in a csv file as the
output.
